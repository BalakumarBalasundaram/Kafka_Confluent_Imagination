# Kafka Real Time Project
Public Transit Status with Apache Kafka.
In this project, you will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. 
Using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.
